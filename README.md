# Cryptography

This repository allows you to encrypt and decrypt files based on a sequence of keystream values generated by a complex algorithm using a deck of cards.

Run the `cipher_program.py` to get a GUI that let's you choose a file and a deck, and gives you the option to encrypt the file or decrypt it. 

Sample decks and encrypted messages are given in the `messages_n_decks` folder.
